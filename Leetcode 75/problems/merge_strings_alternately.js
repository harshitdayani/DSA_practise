// Sample Problem: Two Sum
// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
// Example:
// Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Output: [0,1]
